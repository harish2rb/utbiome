		<p>Rapid advances in sequencing technology have made it possible to investigate the microbiome 
		that surrounds us in unprecedented depth.  While much attention has focused recently on the human 
		microbiome, the bacterial and fungal microbial community that surrounds us is equally as important.  
		Indeed, we are now using pyrosequencing and other next generation techniques to identify the 
		microorganisms present in our drinking water, in the air we breathe and in the surface water 
		and soil surrounding us.</p> 
		<p>The effect of climate change on microbial diversity, the interactions 
		between human occupation and the microbiome present in buildings, the rich microbial community present 
		in surface water, tap water and even reused water can now be explored in new ways.  However, much of this
		data is difficult to access for our students and even for fellow researchers who are interested in investigating 
		the environmental, health and ecological implications of this newfound diversity of microorganisms.   
		</p>
		<p>The proposed UT BIOME project addresses this need by: (1) engaging the UT community in the collection and analysis
		of environmental samples from across the UT Austin campus (essentially using UT Austin as a “living” laboratory) 
		and (2) developing an interactive mapping platform that users within and outside the university can access 
		to download biome results and associated environmental data by simply clicking on the interactive map.  
		While the initial platform will be developed for the microbiome and associated environmental data collected 
		from across campus, we envision that the platform will provide a foundation that can be used in the future 
		by the broader community for any variety of environmental, energy, infrastructure or even health related 
		coursework or research.</p>
