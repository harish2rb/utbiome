                <h2>Rapid advances in sequencing technology have made it possible
                    to investigate the microbial communities that surround us in 
                    unprecedented depth. The interactions between humans and the 
                    microbiome present in buildings as well as the rich microbial 
                    community present in surface water, tap water and even reused 
                    water can now be explored in new ways. However, much of this 
                    data is difficult to access for our students and even for fellow 
                    researchers who are interested in investigating the environmental, 
                    health and ecological implications of this newfound diversity of 
                    microorganisms.

            The UT BIOME project was initiated in 2013 to address this need by: 
            <ol>
                <li>(1)  Engaging the UT community in the collection and 
                    analysis of environmental samples from across the UT 
                    Austin campus (our “Living Laboratory”) and;
                </li>
                <li>
                    (2)  Developing an interactive mapping platform that users
                    within and outside the university can access to download
                    biome results and associated environmental data by simply
                    clicking on the interactive map.

                <p>The site you are visiting is the result of these efforts to date.
                    Nearly 300 students have participated in the collection and 
                    analysis of the microbiome and associated environmental data 
                    summarized on the map. While we are already integrating this 
                    map into our curriculum and research, this platform also provides
                    a foundation that can be used by others for any variety of 
                    environmental, energy, infrastructure or even health related work.
                    Stay tuned for updates as we continue to add to this interactive 
                    map and work with collaborators across campus and beyond. If you                    
                    are interested in adding your data to the map or would like to 
                    adapt this approach for your university or college, please contact
