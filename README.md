http://crwr-utbiome.austin.utexas.edu/utb_webapp/utbiome.html


A web application built using ArcGIS js.
This application uses ArcGIS js API to read environmental variables collected across UT campus.
The folder structure is
  \css
  \js
  \d3
  \index.html
  \utbiomedata.html
  \utbiomemaps.html
  \utbiometeam.html

The css has the revelent css files used in the project
The js has the js that reads the csv and makes the magic with the maps
The d3 folder is a minified version of d3 http://d3js.org/
The index.html is the main page
the utbiomedata, utbiomemap and utbiometeam names pretty much tell what they are.

The data is not provided here..
Also the images are not provided ... as I think those are integral to the project..

So the idea is make your data.. and your images and the code should work 

I will probably put some dummy data up on the data and images folder(soon!) so that you can get a sense of the structure of the input data files ...

Major part of the input data preparation was done through QRCODES and google doc scripts.. I will add them shortly.. once I clean them up.
